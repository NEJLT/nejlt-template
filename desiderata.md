* sans serif; biolinium is nice, so's the ACM journal one
* denser font than LNCS
* make decent use of the page; ACM margins
* A4
* title should be clear: large, separated, bold strokes
* two-column, with the righ separation
* maybe adapt from CVPR in general front page layout?
* optional line numbers for drafting, in different colour like cvpr
* abstract: lrec-style, acm-style, or acl-style?
* tables & figures: captions below please
* acl-style bib commands are nice
* name-style inline citations like acl
* bibliography in new section; whole-width entries, like acm
* no author bio section, god no not ever
* some bold black area somewhere
* a stencil of the logo. maybe yggdrasil or odin's triple horn, not a valknut
* avoid hyperref
* bundle everything into one include, so e.g article, fontsize aren't [] options
* force accessibility
